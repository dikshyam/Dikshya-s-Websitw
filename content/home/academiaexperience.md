  * Working with Dr. Victor Chen (Belk College of Business, UNCC) and Dr. Wlodek Zadrozny (College of Computing and Informatics, UNCC; former IBM Watson Employee).
  * Primary focus of research is building a Causality map between various dependent and independent variables. We are developing a machine learning algorithm, built on natural language processing (NLP) models, that mines a large volume of scientific publications into a causal network for multi-stakeholder KPIs. This algorithm will be built upon Mine Semantic Analysis (MSA) (a result from the PIâ€™s previous research, funded by NSF I-Corps Grant #1624035 during 2016-2017) as well as its descendant Concept Multimodal Embedding (CME).
