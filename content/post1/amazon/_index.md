I recently completed an internship with Amazon, working in their Seller Lending Research Team in an Applied Science Intern role. This department is a relatively new venture taken up by Amazon. Amazon began lending to Sellers in 2011 and enabled businesses that sell products and services on Amazon to reinvest in their businesses so they can reach even more Amazon customers. The Lending team has grown the business tremendously over the past eight years and are now expanding into new products and solutions for a diverse set of customer types. Thereâ€™s lots to do and our work will have an immediate impact on Amazon and it's customers. Science is critical to all Lending products, and we are leveraging talented scientists as well as engineers to deliver results for various projects important to Amazon, sometimes unrelated to Lending. Lending already have existing predictive models that they used for determining eligibility. My internship project was focused on finding areas of development in the existing models and work towards resolving it.
My role was an Applied Science role. The main challenge that comes with this role is the level of ambiguity that's associated with the data and the problem statement. Had it not been for my manager, **Aimie Faucett**, who was always there to answer any questions I had and my mentors, **Di Zeng and Barrett Kirwan**, who can save the world with equations and helped me work out the math for my problem statement. My teammates were some of the nicest people I've met and were always there for me! 
Starting from identifying data sources, to acquiring them to making an evaluation pipeline to facilitate A/B testing in the future, Amazon has challenged me in ways I could never fathom. Over the 3 months timespan, I've picked up a variety of new skills like PySpark, AWS, Panel Data Analysis, Stata, t-SQL and delve further into the concepts I thought I knew including some topics in Statistics and Machine Learning. My internship taught me how to be independent. How to figure everything out on your own! How to talk and write like a Scientist!

It was an amazing experience and it's a great way to kickstart your career in Data Science. I totally, totally recommend doing an internship at Amazon!
