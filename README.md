# Welcome to my Website!

**Dikshya** is a machine learning researcher developing new deep learning architectures to solve problems in the field of biometrics with a focus on face recognition and privacy protection. Among others, his research activities include applications of machine learning to solve problems in (computational) biology. After receiving his doctorate from Michigan State University, Sebastian recently joined the University of Wisconsin-Madison as Assistant Professor of Statistics.

Dikshya has many years of experience with coding in Python and has given several seminars on the practical applications of data science and machine learning, and deep learning over the years, including a machine learning tutorial at SciPy, the leading conference for scientific computing in Python. Dikshya loves to write and talk about data science, machine learning, and Python, and he is very motivated to help people developing data-driven solutions without necessarily requiring a machine learning background. His work and contributions has been recently recognized by the departmental outstanding graduate student award 2016-2017.

In her free time, Dikshya loves to contribute to open source projects, and methods that he implemented are now successfully used in machine learning competitions such as Kaggle.
